            Welcome to <strong>Mogawinch HQ</strong>, a site dedicated to thoughtful, honest, and down-to-earth video game reviews.
            Our goal is to help players discover games that truly deserve their time and money.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike traditional reviews that focus purely on technical or graphical fidelity, we place our emphasis on 
            <strong>the value a game provides for its market price</strong>. Whether it’s a small indie gem or a massive AAA release,
            we evaluate how well the experience, gameplay depth, and content justify its cost.
            Each score reflects the overall quality of a game relative to its price with a 10 representing an outstanding experience 
            that offers exceptional value.

            <p class="writer-desc">
                Mark has worked in the video game industry for several years, primarily at Ubisoft, where he developed a strong 
                understanding of how games are designed and produced. A lifelong gamer across both PC and consoles, his reviews 
                focus on honesty, clarity, and how much <em>value</em> a game truly delivers for its market price.  
                <br><br>
                To maintain transparency and avoid conflicts of interest, Mark does not review Ubisoft titles.
