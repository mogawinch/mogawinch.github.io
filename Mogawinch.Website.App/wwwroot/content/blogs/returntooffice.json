        "I won't talk about what happening at Ubisoft, because I can't and don't want to. Instead, I’ll focus this blog post on the return to office and why it’s bad news for individuals. What is often presented as a simple organizational change has very real consequences once you look at it from a personal point of view.",
        "Remote work was not just a bonus that appeared during an unusual period. For many people, it was a practical way to deal with rising costs. Rent keeps going up, groceries are more expensive, and transportation costs add up quickly. Working from home reduced daily expenses and gave back time that would otherwise be lost commuting. Removing that flexibility means the individual absorbs those costs again, usually without any salary adjustment.",
        "This is also where return to office starts acting as a silent way to reduce headcount. When people leave because they cannot afford the commute, cannot reorganize their lives, or simply burn out, it is labeled as personal choice or attrition. On paper, there are no layoffs. In reality, the effect is the same. Over time, fewer companies will offer real flexibility, not because it does not work, but because it becomes an easy lever to pull when cost pressure appears. In a world where everything costs more, flexibility was not a luxury. It was a way to cope, and taking it away is bad news for individuals."
