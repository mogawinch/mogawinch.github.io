        "I finally played The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom almost two years after release. At first glance, I was skeptical. Visually, it looked very close to Link’s Awakening’s remake, and I feared another reused take on A Link to the Past’s map. For a full-priced Nintendo release, that was a real concern. The only element that truly made me curious was the new echo mechanic.",
        "I was wrong. While the game builds on familiar geography, the world is expanded and reshaped. It feels larger and develops its own personality over time. What initially looks recycled gradually reveals itself as an evolution. For longtime fans, this becomes one of the game’s biggest strengths: there are a good amount of callbacks to previous Zelda entries. Some small details that feel like deliberate love letters to the franchise’s history and players who experience those games.",
        "From a gameplay perspective, the echo system is a suprising reinvention of the 2D formula. Instead of relying on traditional dungeon items, Zelda replicates objects and enemies to solve puzzles and traverse the world. It encourages experimentation and creativity. Despite the mechanical shift, the experience still feels unmistakably Zeldaesque. Exploration, discovery, and the satisfaction of solving puzzles are all intact.",
        "That said, the system is not perfectly balanced. Some echoes are clearly overpowered (the bed is VERY useful) and can trivialize encounters or bypass puzzle solutions entirely. Player freedom is great, but occasionally it comes at the cost of challenge. The real frustration, however, is the menu. Managing echoes through a too simple and awkward interface slows down the pacing more than it should. The favorite system is a welcome addition, but it is not enough.",
        "Outside of mechanics, the charm carries the experience. Some characters are simple but memorable. The Great Fairy, in example, has an unexpected amount of sass that genuinely made me smile. Boss fights are creative enough and push you to engage with the echo system in interesting ways rather than relying on sword fight.",
        "The story is straightforward, but that simplicity works in its favor. It never tries to overcomplicate things. Instead, it provides just enough narrative motivation to keep the adventure engaging from start to finish. Echoes of Wisdom may not redefine the franchise the way Breath of the Wild did, but it successfully subvert the 2D formula in a refreshing way.",
        "In terms of value for money, Echoes of Wisdom delivers. I still think, like Link Awakening’s, that the game is a bit short to justify paying the full price, but if you can find it at a small discount, it is a very good game."
