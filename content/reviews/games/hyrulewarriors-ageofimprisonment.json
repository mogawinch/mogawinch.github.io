        "Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is, simply put, the most fun I’ve ever had with a Warriors game. Koei Tecmo know what they are doing with the Zelda IP. They know how to capture the essence of the original game and transform it into the style they have developed over the years.",
        "Having played most of the Fire Emblem Warriors and Hyrule Warriors titles (minus Age of Calamity) this entry stands above the rest in terms of gameplay depth and overall excitement. It nails the blend of styles of game in a way that feels respectful to the franchise. The story is also surprisingly strong (not what I expect for a Musou game in general). In fact, I would say it stands alongside the mainline Zelda games. The pacing is solid and the build-up of the story never gets lost in its details.",
        "One of the highlights for me is the cast of characters. I truly enjoyed playing as heroes both familiar and completely new to the Zelda universe. Even though some of the original characters don’t get as much development as I would have liked, they are still incredibly fun to control. A few even feature surprisingly strong voice performances. It’s honestly refreshing for me to see creative additions to the roster rather than relying solely on already established characters.",
        "The use of Zonai devices and the variety of mechanics inspired by Tears of the Kingdom feel extremely polished. The gadgets, the combos and the special attacks come together in a way that is satisfying. The game successfully built upon Tears of the Kingdom's spirit and reimagines multiple ideas for Warriors combat.",
        "If there is one flaw that stands out, it’s the transition between cutscenes and gameplay. The switch often feels abrupt, almost as if the cinematics and gameplay were created in different engines. It breaks immersion at times and can be a bit distracting. It's not enough to ruin the experience, but it's noticeable and occasionally annoying.",
        "Another minor downside is some of the battlefield designs and missions feel too linear and constrained. Many missions take place in small generic areas rather than feeling like part of Hyrule, I would have liked to see more recognizable points of interest in the battlefield to make those really part of the world of Zelda.",
        "Despite these issues, the overall experience is fantastic. The gameplay is addictive, the story is surprisingly good, and the roster is fun. It feels like Koei Tecmo continue to learn from previous Warriors collaborations and successfully refine the formula into a truly standout title."
