    "Paragraph": [
        "PUBG is ending support for Xbox One and PS4 this year, and it raises an interesting question: when is it time for developers to leave old consoles behind? The decision makes sense from a development standpoint. Focusing on current-gen hardware means better visuals, more complex gameplay, and faster updates. Players on these systems will probably get a smoother experience and more exciting content in the future.",
        "On the other hand, it leaves a lot of people out. Some players are still on older consoles, and this move could feel frustrating for them. It’s easy to see why some might feel abandoned, especially if they invested a lot of time in the game.",
        "I think this reflects a broader trend in the industry. It’s hard for studios to maintain multiple versions of a game without compromising quality. Personally, I understand why it happens, but it also makes me think about how quickly consoles become outdated and how that affects gamers. In the end, focusing on current-gen systems is probably better for the long-term health of a game, but it also marks the end of an era for older consoles and the players who still use them."
